# **TypedBus (tB)**

TypedBus (`tB`) and TypedBusEvents (`tBE`) provide a powerful, type-safe event bus for Dart applications. With TypedBus, you can publish and subscribe to strongly-typed events, ensuring safe communication between different parts of your application.

This library offers compile-time and runtime safety, allowing developers to write clean and predictable event-driven code.

---

## **Features**

- üéØ **Type-Safe Event Handling**: Events are tied to specific data types, ensuring only valid payloads are passed.
- ‚ö° **Dynamic Event Registration**: Register new events and their types dynamically using `TBE`.
- üîî **Subscription Management**: Subscribe to events and listen to typed data.
- üì§ **Publish Events**: Publish strongly-typed events globally.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Protects against mismatched event types during publishing and subscribing.

---

## **Installation**

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  typed_bus: ^1.0.0
```

Then fetch the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Register Events**

Before publishing or subscribing, register events and their expected payload types using `tBE.registerEvent`:

```dart
tBE.registerEvent<String>('event1');
```

### **2. Subscribe to Events**

Use `tB.subscribe` to listen for specific events. Subscribers receive only the payloads of the registered type:

```dart
tB.subscribe<String>('event1').listen((String data) {
  print('Received Event 1: $data');
});
```

### **3. Publish Events**

Use `tB.publish<T>` to send events globally with their corresponding payloads:

```dart
tB.publish<String>('event1', "Hello world!"); 
```

### **4. Error Handling**

If you attempt to publish or subscribe with mismatched types, the library will throw a runtime exception. Be cautious with types, especially when using generics like `Map`.

#### **Example of a Mismatched Type**
```dart
tB.publish<String>('action3', SomethingCrazy(
  options: {},
  option1: true,
  option2: false,
  option3: true,
  option4: false,
));
// Throws an exception: Type mismatch
```

---

## **API Reference**

### **TypedBusEvents (TBE)**

#### **Register an Event**
```dart
tBE.registerEvent<T>(String event);
```
- Registers a new event with the specified payload type `<T>`.

#### **Example**
```dart
tBE.registerEvent<String>('my_event');
```

---

### **TypedBus (TB)**

#### **Subscribe to an Event**
```dart
Stream<T> tB.subscribe<T>(String event);
```
- Subscribes to an event and listens for payloads of type `<T>`.

#### **Publish an Event**
```dart
void tB.publish<T>(String event, T data);
```
- Publishes an event globally with the given payload.

---

## **Example Usage**

```dart
import 'package:typed_bus/typed_bus.dart';


void main() {
  // Register events
  tBE.registerEvent<String>('eventName');

  // Subscribe to events
  tB.subscribe<String>('eventName').listen((data) {
    print('Received eventName: $data');
  });

  tB.publish<String>('eventName', 'Hello world!');  
}
```

---

## **Advanced Usage**

### **Custom Types**

For events with a custom type, just use it. 

#### Define your custom type
```dart
class TodoItem {
  String description;
  bool isDone;

  TodoItem({required this.description, required this.isDone});

  @override
  String toString() {
    return 'TodoItem(description: $description, isDone: $isDone)';
  }
}
```

#### Use your custom type
```dart

tBE.registerEvent<TodoItem>("toggle");

tB.subscribe<TodoItem>('toggle').listen((TodoItem item) {
  // do something with the item
  toggleItem(item);
});

tB.publish<TodoItem>(
    'toggle', TodoItem(description: "Publish Toggle Event", isDone: false));
```


### **Dynamic Payloads**

For events where the payload type isn‚Äôt fixed, you can use `dynamic`:

```dart
tBE.registerEvent<dynamic>('dynamic_event');

tB.subscribe<dynamic>('dynamic_event').listen((data) {
  print('Dynamic event received: $data');
});

tB.publish<dynamic>('dynamic_event', {'key': 'value'});
tB.publish<dynamic>('dynamic_event', 12345);
```
